# android-MVVM
This is an example to demonstrate MVVM with repository

MVVM has mainly the following layers:

## Repository
The repository serves as the communication bridge between the data and the rest of the app.

## ViewModel
ViewModel should bridge the Repository and the View, this is also where your Business Logic lives.

## View
Finally, the view role in this pattern is to observe (or subscribe to) a ViewModel observable to get data in order to update UI elements accordingly.
